# Retour Ã  la ligne terminal:
	I prefer using a custom .bashrc file
	First, append the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:

	##
	## INCLUDE CUSTOM `.bashrc` CODE
	##
	if [ -f ~/.bashrc_custom ]; then
	    . ~/.bashrc_custom
	fi
	Create the custom file:

	touch ~/.bashrc_custom`
	Finally open it and put the following lines into:

	# File: $HOME/.bashrc_custom
	# THIS FILE IS A USER-CUSTOM BASHRC FILE TO KEEP CLEAN THE DEFAULT ~/.barshrc FILE.
	# PUT THERE ANY CUSTOM CODE MANUALLY ADDED BY YOU


	# Add a new line at the end of the command prompt
	#PS1=${PS1}\\n
	PS1=${PS1%?}
	PS1=${PS1%?}\n'$ '
	The next opened shell session will looks like following:

	user@host:~
	$ <your-next-command-will-be-rendered-here>
